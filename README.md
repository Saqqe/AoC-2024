# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 with Python and AI 🤖

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! 🎅

This project is dedicated to solving the daily challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using **Python** and leveraging AI tools like **ChatGPT** as much as possible.

## 🎯 Goals
- Solve each day's puzzle using Python.
- Experiment with different **Large Language Models (LLMs)** each week to explore their capabilities in programming and problem-solving.
- Learn, iterate, and document insights about working with AI for coding tasks.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for solving the challenges.
- **ChatGPT & Other LLMs**: To assist in brainstorming, debugging, and coding solutions.

## 🗓️ Weekly LLM Rotation Plan
Each week, I will use a different LLMs to from based on: https://bigcode-bench.github.io/
- Week 1: [ChatGPT gpt-4o](https://chatgpt.com/)
- Week 2: [Claude 3.5 Haiku](https://claude.ai/new)
- Week 3: [Codeium](https://codeium.com/)
- Week 4: [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `dayXX/`: Each day's puzzle solution and related files.
  - `notes/`: Insights, AI interaction logs, and reflections.
- `README.md`: This file!

## 💡 Reflections
Throughout the journey, I'll document my experience with each LLM:

- What worked well?
- What challenges did I face?
- How effective was the model in understanding and solving puzzles?
