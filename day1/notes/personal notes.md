## ðŸ’¡ Reflections

**1. What worked well?**  
- The model quickly understood the Advent of Code puzzles and provided clear, well-structured Python code to solve them.  
- Summaries of the puzzle were concise yet comprehensive.  
- The ability to adapt the conversation into a shareable format (Markdown and downloadable file) was seamless.  

**2. What challenges did I face?**  
- No significant challenges were encountered, though verifying the puzzle descriptions and adapting to changing requirements required attention to detail.  
- **Going into puzzle 2 the model missed we were on a differnet puzzle. Had to re-tell it more exactly what to solve.**

**3. How effective was the model in understanding and solving puzzles?**  
- The model was highly effective, accurately interpreting and providing solutions that met the requirements.  
- Code explanations were clear and ensured I could easily follow and implement the solutions.
